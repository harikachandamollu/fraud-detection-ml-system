# Fraud Detection ML System

A structured machine learning project for learning and practicing **end-to-end ML workflows** using a fraud detection use case.
This repository focuses on building good habits around data handling, model training, and experiment tracking.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

* Practice working with an **imbalanced classification problem**
* Learn how to structure ML code beyond notebooks
* Understand model evaluation and experiment tracking using MLflow
* Gain hands-on experience with common steps in the ML lifecycle

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow following common ML engineering practices, including data validation, feature engineering, experiment tracking, model evaluation, and API deployment.

## 📊 Dataset

* IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset
* Highly imabalanced (~3% fraud)
* High-dimensional tabular data
* Significant missing values

## ⚠️ Notes on Data

* The dataset is used as a realistic proxy for financial transaction data. 
* Dataset files are excluded from version control
* Paths assume data exists locally under `data/raw/`

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to:

* Understand target imbalance
* Identify missing-value patterns
* Distinguish numerical vs categorical features
* Highlight potential data quality issues

EDA is kept separate from production code and documented in:
* `notebooks/eda.ipynb`
* `docs/eda_summary.md`

---

## 🧠 Key Choices (Learning-focused)

* **Target:** Fraud vs Non-Fraud (binary classification)
* **Primary metric:** ROC-AUC
* **Secondary metric:** Recall at a fixed threshold
* **Validation strategy:** Stratified train/validation split
* **Baseline model:** Logistic Regression
* **Tree-based model:** LightGBM
* **Experiment tracking:** MLflow (SQLite backend)

Design decisions and reasoning are documented in `DECISIONS.md`.

--- 

## 🧱 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering focuses on **simple, robust techniques** suitable for tabular data:

* Dropping constant / near-constant features
* Frequency encoding for categorical variables
* Missing-value indicator features
* Filling remaining missing values
* Feature scaling where appropriate

The feature engineering pipeline is implemented in `src/feature_engineering.py`.

---

## 🧪 Model Training

Two models are trained and compared:

* **Baseline:** Logistic Regression  
* **Final model:** LightGBM

Training includes:
* Stratified train/validation split
* Handling class imbalance
* Logging parameters and metrics to MLflow

Training logic is implemented in `src/train.py`.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Because of class imbalance:
* Accuracy is not used
* ROC-AUC is the primary metric
* Precision-recall trade-offs are analyzed

Instead of relying on a default probability cutoff, threshold selection is treated as a **deliberate decision**.

Evaluation and threshold logic are implemented in:
* `src/evaluate.py`
* `src/threshold_analysis.py`

---

## 🏆 Model Performance

Experiments were tracked using MLflow. Logistic Regression was used as a baseline model and compared against a LightGBM classifier.

| Model | Precision | Recall | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Logistic Regression | 0.144 | 0.732 | 0.866 |
| LightGBM | 0.289 | 0.840 | 0.953 |

LightGBM achieved better fraud classification performance compared with the baseline model, improving ranking capability and precision on the validation dataset.

The results demonstrate the benefit of using gradient boosting models for complex tabular fraud detection problems with imbalanced classes.

All experiment parameters, metrics, and model artifacts are tracked using MLflow.

---

## 📉 Data Drift Detection

To explore how models can degrade over time, basic **data drift detection** is implemented using:

* Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test
* Population Stability Index (PSI)

These techniques help identify distribution changes in incoming data and are implemented in `src/drift_detection.py`.

This is intended as a learning exercise, not a full monitoring system.

---

## 📊 Experiment Tracking (MLflow)

All experiments are tracked using **MLflow**, including:

* Model parameters
* Evaluation metrics
* Trained model artifacts

The MLflow UI can be locally to inspect runs and compare models.

Start the MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

Then open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🌐 Inference API (FastAPI)

A simple inference service is implemented to demonstrate how a trained model can be used in an application:

* Built using FastAPI
* Loads the selected model from MLflow
* Exposes a `/predict` endpoint
* Includes automatic Swagger documentation

API code lives in `src/api/main.py`

This steps is intended to bridge model training and application integration.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1️⃣ Create environment

```bash
conda create -n fraud-ml python=3.10 -y
conda activate fraud-ml
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Training Pipeline

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will:

* Load and merge transaction and identity data
* Build features
* Train a baseline Logistic Regression model
* Train a LightGBM model
* Log metrics, parameters, and models to MLflow

---

## 🔮 Possible Next Steps

Planned or optional extensions include:

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Automated retraining based on drift
* Model explainability (e.g. SHAP)
* Containerization and cloud deployment
These are intentionally left out of the current scope.
